Project Overview
This project is part of the final course assignment in Machine Learning Applications using Python. It focuses on implementing and evaluating classification and regression models, including data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Requirements
The project was completed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and includes the following major components:

Data Preprocessing
Classification and Regression Model Training
Hyperparameter Tuning
Model Evaluation and Selection
Key Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Import and Preprocessing
Imported and loaded the dataset using pandas.
Checked and handled duplicate values using DataFrame.duplicated() and drop_duplicates().
Dealt with missing values using various imputation techniques.
Converted categorical variables into dummy variables (one-hot encoding).
Normalized and standardized the data to improve model performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distributions, checked for outliers, and performed summary statistics.
Visualized data distributions and category frequencies to gain insights.
Checked class balance and applied class balancing techniques.
3. Classification Models
Used XGBoost, Random Forest, and LGBM for classification.
Implemented a custom neural network using Keras for additional classification analysis.
Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
Evaluated classification models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
4. Regression Models
Built regression models using Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Lasso, and Ridge.
Evaluated regression models with metrics including RÂ², RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Used polynomial transformations and regularization techniques to improve model fit and prevent overfitting.
5. Advanced Model Evaluation and Selection
Compared multiple models and selected the best model based on performance on both training and test sets.
Explained the concepts of overfitting and underfitting and applied cross-validation to reduce overfitting.
